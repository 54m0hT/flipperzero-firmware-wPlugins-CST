### Installation
Unfortunately since flipc.org is down you will have to build from source using [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) or [fbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/fbt.md)

I am working on getting the [Build Flipper Application Package](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-flipper-application-package-fap) working so you can get the .fap directly from this repo

You will also need to install my [ESP32 Spotify Remote](https://github.com/benjamindrussell/esp32-spotify-remote) on the WiFi Devboard
