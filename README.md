### Installation
Unfortunately since flipc.org is down you will have to build from source using [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) or [fbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/fbt.md)

You will also need to install my [ESP32 Spotify Remote] on the WiFi Devboard
