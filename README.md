# Flipper_Zero_FMF2USBMIDI

Convert Flipper Zero Music Player file to USB-MIDI Signal.

this code was tested in Flipper Zero SDK v50.1 to v54.0

It is still under development.
I would like to add various functions when we feel like it.
It's unstable sometimes, so please tolerate it.
The license for this FAP shall be WTFPL.


# Requirements
Basically, just go to the directory, set up ufbt, and type ufbt.
For more information, please see Flipper Zero's FAP build instructions.
It is very detailed.

If you see me in a chat room somewhere, feel free to throw me about $3.
Of course, you can also give me the middle finger.
