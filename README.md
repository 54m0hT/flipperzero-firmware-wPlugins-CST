## Overview

The FlipBoard v1.1 is a versatile device for the Flipper Zero that can enable all kinds of features. It has 4 buttons that connect via separate GPIO pins, so you can react to any combinations of button up/down events. Each button has a 24-bit color LED that is programmable using the WS2812b protocol. There is also a small single-color LED on the board you can use, for example, to signal a status change.

Currently there are three applications written for the FlipBoard that demonstrate many of the key features.  FlipKeyboard is a macropad application that can automate repetative tasks, typing many keys in a single button click.  FlipBlinky is visual effects, useful if you are wearing your Flipper Zero with FlipBoard as a badge at a conference.  FlipSignal sends Sub-GHz and IR signals.  We will be adding more applications as time progresses, along with tutorials on how to write your own applications! Please let us know your feedback.

You can order your FlipBoard from [https://tindie.com/stores/MakeItHackin](https://tindie.com/stores/MakeItHackin).

## Installing Apps

There are multiple ways to install applications on your Flipper Zero.  If you just want to run the apps without making any customizations, you can install a FAP (Flipper Application Package) file that is built for you.  If you want to customize the app & follow along with the various tutorials, it is recommended you install the source code and build it yourself!

If you just want to run applications without customizing, here are some options:
- GOOD OPTION: [Install using flipc.org (requires Chrome, Edge or Opera web browser)](#using-flipcorg-chrome-edge-opera)
- [Download FAP from flipc.org (Other browsers)](#using-flipcorg-other-browsers)
  - [Install FAP on Flipper using qFlipper](#copying-fap-using-qflipper)
  - [Install FAP on Flipper using SD Card](#copying-fap-using-sd-card)

If you want to modify the code, here are some options:
- BEST OPTION: [Build FAP with VSCode (Visual Studio Code)](#building-with-vscode-visual-studio-code)
- [Build FAP with FBT tool](#building-with-fbt)
- [Build FAP with UFBT tool](#building-with-ufbt)

### Using flipc.org (Chrome, Edge, Opera)

For best experience, use the latest version of Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Opera.  Other browsers will only give you a file you need to manually install (since they don't support the [Web Serial API](https://caniuse.com/web-serial)).

Flipc.org is a website that allows you to install FAP files directly from the web.  This is an unofficial website and is not affiliated with the Flipper Zero team, run by a single person.  It is provided as a convenience for users who want to install apps without having to build them from source.

![Flipc.org install](images/flipc-install.gif)

- Step 1: **Load the web page** for the app you want to install.  Other people may have "forked" the app and made their own version, so make sure you are using the correct link.  In some cases, their changes may improve the product, but in other cases, they may have introduced bugs or malicious code.  **Use at your own risk.**

  - https://flipc.org/jamisonderek/flipboard?branch=main&root=flipkeyboard

- Step 2: Click on the underlined text under FIRMWARE and **choose the firmware** that matches what you are running on your Flipper Zero. (Official, Unleashed, RogueMaster, Xtreme)
- Step 3: Click on the underlined text under CHANNEL and **choose the current channel** you are running on your Flipper Zero.  (Release, Release Candidate, Development)
- Step 4: **Connect your Flipper Zero** to your computer. Make sure nothing is running on your computer that is using the serial port.  In particular, close qFlipper, close https://lab.flipper.net, and close any CLI tools that communicate with the Flipper Zero.
- Step 5: Click on the orange **Install button**.
  - The application should get installed.
  - The Install button should change to an orange Run of Flipper button.
  - You can try "Run on Flipper" to run the application, but this will not work for all firmware versions.

### Using flipc.org (Other browsers)

For best experience, use the latest version of Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Opera.  Other browsers will only give you a file you need to manually install (since they don't support the [Web Serial API](https://caniuse.com/web-serial)).

- Step 5: Eject the SD Card from your computer & insert it back into your Flipper Zero.

### Building with VSCode (Visual Studio Code) 

This is the recommended configuration if you are going to be editing the existing applications or writing your own.  You will get code completion and be able to step into the firmware code, finding out how a specific function works.

**Prerequisites:**

Most of the prerequisites links have a default "Download" button on the landing page (look for a button that says `Download` or has a download icon).  For each of the installers, after you accept the license agreement, you can just click "Next" through the rest of the install process.

- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install GIT tools](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Configure VSCode:
- Step 1: Make sure you have installed the above prerequisites.
- Step 2: Create a folder called `repos` in your home directory.  You can use any folder you want, but this tutorial assumes you are using `/repos` folder.  If you are using Windows, you can use `C:\repos` or `C:\Users\yourname\repos` or any other folder you want.
- Step 3: Open VSCode.
- Step 4: Clone the Flipboard repository.
  - Step 4a: `View`/`Command Palette`/`Git: Clone`
  - Step 4b: Enter the URL of the flipboard repository `https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipboard.git` then click **Clone from URL** and choose your `/repos` folder as the target.  This will create a folder called `flipboard` in your `repos` folder.
  - Step 4c: When prompted if you would like to open the repository, choose `Open`.
  - Step 4d: When prompted if you trust the authors, choose `Yes` (or choose `No` if you prefer.)
- Step 5: **Recursively clone** the firmware repository.   Be sure you choose `Git: Clone (Recursive)` from the `Command Palette` menu.  This is different than the `Git: Clone` command you ran in the previous step!
  - Step 5a: `View`/`Command Palette`/`Git: Clone (Recursive)`
  - Step 5b: Enter the URL of the firmware you would like to run on your Flipper and choose your `/repos` folder as the target.
    - Official: `https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git`
    - Unleashed: `https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware.git`

  - NOTE: THIS IS RECURSIVELY CLONING THE REPOSITORY.  This may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your internet connection.
  - Step 5c: When prompted if you would like to open the repository, choose `Open`.
  - Step 5d: When prompted if you trust the authors, choose `Yes` (so you will be able to build the code later.)
  - You may get a warning about "13 submodules".  This is normal, you can safely ignore this warning.
- Step 6: Open GIT tools
  - Step 6a: Open the GIT CMD window (or any new command window should be fine.)
  - Step 6b: Type `git` and press enter.
  - Step 6c: If you get a message that says `git is not recognized as an internal or external command`, then you need to add the git tools to your path.
- Step 7: Install VSCode tools
  - Step 7a: Close VSCode and reopen it.
  - Step 7b: In VSCode, make sure the Explorer window is open (`View`/`Explorer`).

  - Step 7d: Type `./fbt vscode_dist` in the Integrated Terminal and press enter.
  - Step 7e: If prompted if you would like to install the recommended extensions, choose `Install`.
  - Step 7f: Close VSCode and reopen it.
  - Step 7g: If prompted if you would like to install the recommended extensions, choose `Install`.
  - Step 7h: Be sure the extensions `CMAKE` and `CMAKE TOOLS` are disabled for the workspace, otherwise Ctrl+Shift+B may not show the build options (and instead show things about `cmake`)!
    - Step 7h1: Click on the `Extensions` icon on the left side of the screen.
    - Step 7h2: Type `cmake` in the search box.
    - Step 7h3: Click on the `CMAKE` extension.
    - Step 7h4: If it has an `Install` button you are done.
    - Step 7h5: If it has a `Disable` button, click on the `Disable` button.

  - Step 7a: Connect your Flipper to the computer.
  - Step 7b: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to bring up the build options.
  - Step 7c: Choose `[Debug] Flash (USB, with resources)`.
  - Step 7d: The firmware and FAPs should get built.
  - Step 7e: The firmware should get installed on the Flipper Zero.
- Step 8: Copy the applications from the flipboard repository to the firmware repository's `application_user` folder.
  - Step 8a: Copy the folder `flipblinky` from `/repos/flipboard/flipblinky` to `./applications_user/flipblinky`.
  - Step 8b: Copy the folder `flipsignal` from `/repos/flipboard/flipsignal` to `./applications_user/flipsignal`.
  - Step 8c: Copy the folder `flipkeyboard` from `/repos/flipboard/flipkeyboard` to `./applications_user/flipkeyboard`.

Build and deploy the application:
  - Step 1: Connect your Flipper to the computer.
  - Step 2: In VSCode, make sure the Explorer window is open (`View`/`Explorer`).
  - Step 2: Open the file `./applications_user/flipblinky/app.c` (or whichever application you want to build)
  - Step 3: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to bring up the build options.
  - Step 4: Choose `[Debug] Launch App on Flipper`.
  - Step 5: The application should get built, the FAP installed on the Flipper Zero, and then the application should get launched.
