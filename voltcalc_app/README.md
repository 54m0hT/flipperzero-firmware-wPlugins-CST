# Voltage Calculator

VoltCalc is a simple voltage calculator to calculate values using Ohms Law V = R * I.

Yes, a calculator or your phone could probably do this much faster, but it seemed like a good first app 
to write on my own from scratch!

This app is not ready to be run, and is only a skeleton at the moment.
